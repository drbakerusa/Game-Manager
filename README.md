# F95 Game Manager
F95 Game Manager is a simple and fast text-based libary manager for your [F95zone](https://f95zone.to/) game library. With it you can keep track of games you find interesting, track how and when you played a game, make comment for yourself to help you remember the game between versions (or however you choose to use them), and keep track of what games you've previously deleted and why.
